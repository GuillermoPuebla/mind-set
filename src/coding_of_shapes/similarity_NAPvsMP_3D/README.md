The figures used in this section have been downloaded from https://geon.usc.edu/~ori/
They are already in the `data/coding_of_shapes/..` folder. 
They are divided in 3 groups: 
- `NPvsMP` is the standard set of geons
- `NPvsMP_no_shades` is a slightly modified version without any shades and with a line contour 
- `NPvsMP_silhouettes` is a version where only the silhouettes are shown for each geon

In all cases, for humans, a metric change (MP) is much more similar to the "base" sample than a Non-Accidental-Change (NAP).
